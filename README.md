# WHEEL-OF-EDJE

## Future Work

### Add Unit Tests

All other JavaScript files have appropriate unit tests.

1. TODO: spinner.js (due to complexity of canvas, will test minimally)
2. TODO: storage.js (due to complexity of mocking, will test minimally)
3. overlay.js (due to complexity of canvas, will not test)
5. external.js

## Firebase
