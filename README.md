## Future Work

### Ideas for Development

1. Import / Export of Data to named json-file.
2. Start Group spin ... automatically select the next, until done.
3. Remote Spinning without a Group.

### Add Unit Tests

All other JavaScript files have appropriate unit tests.

1. TODO: spinner.js (due to complexity of canvas, will test minimally)
2. TODO: storage.js (due to complexity of mocking, will test minimally)
3. overlay.js (due to complexity of canvas, will not test)
4. external.js
5. external-peer.js
6. dedicated-peer.js

## GitHub Deployment

Automatic.

## Firebase (deprecated)

### Development

This project is no longer on Firebase.
