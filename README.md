# WHEEL-OF-EDJE

## Testing

```script
npm test
```

## Future Work

### Ideas for Development

1. Remote Spinning without a Group.

### Add Unit Tests

All other JavaScript files have appropriate unit tests.

1. TODO: spinner.js (due to complexity of canvas, will test minimally)
2. TODO: storage.js (due to complexity of mocking, will test minimally)
3. overlay.js (due to complexity of canvas, will not test)
4. external.js
5. external-peer.js
6. dedicated-peer.js

## GitHub Deployment

Automatic.
